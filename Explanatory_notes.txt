I am sending you my master file for the CGM project using tracer particles.
It is faaaaar too complicated for me to try and predict which bits you will need
and far to complicated for you to try and use all of it, so I'm going to write
this summary here. As always, please dm me on Slack if you run into trouble, or
have questions.

My analysis is split into two core functions in the main analysis:
1. Select our Tracers of interest in tracer_selection_snap_analysis()
2. Iterate over time, selecting only the tracers that were of interest in 1,
   and saving their data (usually in a hdf5 .h5 file). This is performed in
   snap_analysis()

These two work almost identically, save for 1. is going from "Cells that have
the right temperature, radius etc, to the tracers within these cells" and
therefore uses get_tracers_from_cells(). 2., however, is now going from those
tracers we selected at our time and properties of interest to the cells they
are now within - therefore using get_cells_from_tracers().

They both follow roughly this setup:
1. Load subfind
2. Load the snapshot of Gas [type = 0], Stars [type = 4], and high res dark
matter [type =1] . This last one is deleted later, but we need the DM to
calculate one of our properties (free fall time, I believe).
3. Load the tracers of the snapshot [type = 6]
4. Prod the lazyloaded snapshots to make sure we load in everything we need
(yes, I could turn lazyload off, but this is marginally faster albeit clunky
and gross...)
5. Use snap_utils functions to calculate halo and subhalo ID's
6. Convert from code units to more useful ones
7. Calculate physical properties in calculate_tracked_parameters() (go look in
here for the properties you want to include!)
8. Make the same number of entries (with either data or a np.nan) for both Stars
and gas in pad_non_entries(). This is crucial to how I solved this problem! You
need to be able to track the tracers moving between stars and gas for some of
the properties I was looking at. This makes that possible by saying, for
example, if tracer 1 is gas at time 1, and tracer 1 is a star at time 2,
you look in the same index in the numpy array for both. Simples!
9. There is some stuff done here to select only high resolution gas
10. Get our cells from tracers or tracers from cells, and return them to the
function outside via the return statement.

The final piece in the puzzle is my Postprocessing step.
This is postprocessing for me only because I didn't know how crucial it would be
In an ideal world I would have found a way to include this step in the main analysis...

Anyway, it uses a function called flatten_wrt_time(). This nomenclature is to
represent that you are going from time1_data = [...], time2_data=[...] (okay,
I actually have dictionaries so it's more like {(25R75,T4,221) = {...}, ...})
for radius 25<R<75, Temperature ~ 1e4 K, and for snapshot 221.).
This has two versions of it's core code. You want to use v2 called
get_individual_cell_from_tracer_all_param_v2(). This uses a scipy interpolate1d
function to map between tracerID (trid), and cellID (id). There's also some
parentID (prid) stuff knocking about (the ID of the cell that tracer is in, so
you link between trid and id).
The idea behind this function is that you go from having data like this:
time1=[x0,x1,...,xn]
time2=[x0,x1,...,xm]
time3=[x0,x1,...,xl]
where n,m,l are different, and are the number of cells included at each timestep
to
[[x0,x1,...,xn],[x0,x1,...,xn],[x0,x1,...,xn],...]
for all of the snapshots, where n is the number of tracers. Each tracer will
have its own copy of the data of the cell it was in from every different
snapshot, or a np.nan if that data doesn't exist (e.g., it wouldn't have age as a gas, or magnetic field strength (B) as a star. Or if it has exited our analysis, this will also be a np.nan).

Then to select any tracer and see it's behaviour, you will just need to [:,ii] or [jj,:] depending on which way your data is stored.
